# Multi-Layer-Perceptron from scratch for classification
Please find the detailed problem statement [here.]()

• Implemented a MLP from scratch using no machine learning libraries.

• Constructed and trained the neural network classifier using provided labeled training data from four different datasets: 

_ Spiral: Both classes are interwoven in a spiral pattern. Data points are subject to noise along their respective spiral and thus may overlap;
- Gaussian: Data points are generated and classified according to two Gaussian distributions. The distributions have different means, but samples may overlap; 
- XOR: Data points classified according to the XOR function. Noise may push data classes over XOR “boundaries”; 
- Circle: Data points are generated and classified according to two annuli (rings) sharing a common center. Although the annuli are not overlapping, noise may push data points across the gap.

• Used the learned classifier to classify the unlabeled test data.

• Completed the training and testing of the model on each dataset in less than 30 seconds.

• Achieved accuracies of 98%, 97.6%, 95.8% and 95.6% respectively on the four datasets mentioned above.
